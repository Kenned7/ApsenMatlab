The simulations were carried out in Aspen Plus (V12.1). 
To perform the sensitivity analysis, MATLAB (MathWorks R2023b) was employed to interface with Aspen Plus. 
A parallel for-loop (parfor) in MATLAB was implemented to execute multiple Aspen Plus simulations simultaneously, 
each corresponding to the specific conditions listed in Table 7 in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.145129
